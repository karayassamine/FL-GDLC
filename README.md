# GDLC: Graph Deep Learning framework based on Centrality measures for IDS

## Overview
GDLC (Graph Deep Learning based on Centrality measures) is a novel framework designed to enhance Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). By leveraging centrality measures within graph-based deep learning models, GDLC aims to improve the detection rates and accuracy of identifying network intrusions, addressing the dynamic and sophisticated nature of cyber threats in IoT environments.
